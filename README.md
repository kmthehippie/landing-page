The great landing page

In accordance to the foundation program by the Odin Project, I am now creating a website based off an image.
I am suppose to be able to show that I can apply all that I have learnt in the CSS and HTML sections of the course.

OKAY. Let's go.

I completed this in 2 and half hours. I think there were many mistakes. Especially since I can't get the footer to stick to the bottom of the viewport.

I need to fix that.

Also, when I follow the fonts given by TOP, the text blows right out of proportion and becomes wayyyy too big. So, I tweaked all the sizes manually so that everything looked roughly like the image given.

I will need to come back and redo the sizing.
